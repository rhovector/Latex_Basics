	All quantum gate operations are linear and reversible. This is because the very nature of quantum mechanics is reversibility and linearity. Since quantum mechanical operations are linear so quantum gates which perform these operations are represented by matrices.

		If the quantum oracle is a constant function the probability of the initial states changing is 0. Hence the first 3 qubits have retained their initial states of 0. In case of a balanced function the probability of the initial states changing is 1 hence the resultant states of the first 3 qubits have changed from 0 to 1. %% New paragraph with a space after previous paragraph %%
		
		Accordingly, measurement of the phase bit will be followed by a randomization

		In the presented QSL algorithms, you are given a black-box QSL gate that implements f by acting on QSL systems, and the same task. Using the QSL framework, we obtain the same success probability and the same time and space complexity as for the quantum algorithms, and these QSL algorithms are in turn efficiently simulatable in classical Turing machines.
